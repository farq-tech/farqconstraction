/**
 * How this UI identifies itself to `/api/construction/*` — one definition for
 * the whole app.
 *
 * Three paths, in this order, and the order is the point:
 *
 *  1. **A real session** (`Authorization: Bearer <access token>`). One account,
 *     one session, every action attributable to a person.
 *  2. **A build-time token**, dev only. Refused in production builds, because
 *     a single token baked into the bundle is a shared session for every
 *     visitor — the opposite of what was asked for.
 *  3. **Demo mode** (`x-construction-demo-user`). The Farq API accepts this
 *     ONLY when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` AND `CONSTRUCTION_DEMO_MODE=1`
 *     (api/lib/construction/runtime.js), so it is not a production hole. It
 *     stays until real auth is proven in production; removing it is a later,
 *     separate step.
 *
 * Suppliers are deliberately absent. A supplier proves identity with the
 * one-use token in their invitation link and carries NO buyer session — see
 * `supplierPortalHeaders`.
